# Balancing Robot Project Overview

To explore the world of machine learning in robotics, I'm interested in building a robot that can balance itself upright on 2 wheels. This isn't for profit or glory of any kind, it'll simply be a fantastic case of project-based learning (a teaching method that I'll promote till the end of time). 

### Goals:
1. Learn new things! (Complex 3D assemblies, Electronics, Robotics, Reinforcement learning)
2. Make something cool and unique, something that colleges and potentially internships in college would be interested in.
3. Practice collaborating with others on a big project like this. (It's been tough to find other CS-inclined people at our school, so all my projects previously have been on my own.)

### Original Sketches:
