# Guitar TAB Generator

<div align="center">
    This repository store the code and 3D modelling files for a Balancing Robot that I'm building with a friend of mine, Asher Levin. It's currently a Work-In-Progress, but maybe the progress we've made so far is of interest to you.

## About the repository

My partner and I are working on this project at the exact same time, so we're keeping our work as separate as possible. Because of this, and because I don't want to install unneeded files onto the Raspberry Pi, we've separated our work onto multiple branches in this repo. 

I, Ryan, am in charge of mechanical design and assembly; buying and building all the parts; and designing/training a model in the reinforcment learning environment. You can see all my 3D models on the `Design` branch. I might expand to other branches for the machine learning process as well.

Asher is in charge of the computer system inside of the robot, including all sensors, motors, and an eventual real-time connection to my reinforcment learning model. You can see most of his work on the `pi` branch, containing all the code he has written on the Raspberry Pi. Eventually, he might make other branches for extra code snippets, perhaps for our arduino nanos.

On the main branch is a few shared files, largely relating to communication between us. Perhaps it can give you insight into our collaboration environment. I might also post occasional project updates every other week or so, to give insight into our current build process.

## What We're doing now

Currently working through our assigned tasks in the [updated project plan.](10-23-24_Task_Guide.md)

  <summary>Background context</summary>
   - Tell us any goals that might help us better understand your project. “Having fun” and “learning” are valid goals.<br/>
 - Context: Who is it for? How is it used? Don't assume these answers are obvious. If you have made a tool or product to address some problem, what else already exists to solve the same problem?<br/>
 - Describe constraints like budget, space, available tooling, etc.s

  <summary>Build process</summary>
   - Tell us more about your build. What was your approach, and why did you decide to do it that way? If there was a design/testing process, what did you do? Consider attaching photos in the subsequent media uploader page to demonstrate your build process.
